# 👗 Fashion MNIST Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset 👕👖👗. It benchmarks the training performance on CPU and GPU, showcasing efficiency gains for deep learning models 🚀.

## 📚 Introduction
In this project, we perform image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each belonging to one of 10 classes of clothing items. We benchmark the training performance on CPU and GPU for models with different complexities.

## 💡 Skills/Concepts Developed
- Image classification using deep learning
- Performance benchmarking on different hardware (CPU vs. GPU)
- Neural network modeling with TensorFlow and Keras

## ❓ Problem Statement
Classify images of clothing items into one of the 10 categories provided in the Fashion MNIST dataset and compare the performance of training on CPU versus GPU.

## 🌟 Impact of Your Work
Understanding the performance differences between CPU and GPU can help optimize the training process for deep learning models, saving time and computational resources.

## 🛠️ Modeling
The modeling process involves defining, training, and evaluating neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Steps
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Define a function to create a neural network model.
3. Train and evaluate the model on CPU and GPU for different configurations.
4. Visualize sample images and their predicted labels.

## 📝 Conclusion
The benchmark results show the time taken for training with different configurations. Generally, training on a GPU is faster than on a CPU, especially as the model complexity increases.

## 📈 Recommendations
For large and complex models, utilizing a GPU can significantly reduce training time. It is also important to preprocess data and structure the model efficiently to maximize performance gains.
